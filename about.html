    <p>Hi, my name is Tighe. I like math. I find Number Theory and Algebra especially appealing.</p>
    
    <br>

    <p>I have found my time spent practicing Mathematics, Judo and Wrestling to be especially worthwhile. My other interests are spending time outdoors and drinking coffee.</p>

    <li><b>Solving Self Assembly</b> - Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference 2024</li>
    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Particle self assembly is the transformation of particles in a disordered system into predetermined structures. Self assembly methods make it possible to build structures on the scale of nano-meters, something previously not possible. This technology has already been applied to important problems such as drug delivery and catalyst recovery. My talk will outline my research to develop a new theoretical model for self assembly, which reaches benchmark yields of completed structures exponentially faster. I will present how the complex problem of finding the best arrangements for self assembly can be reduced to a simple mathematical problem, providing deep insights and a simple solution.</p>

    <li><b>Blocks and Blueprints: Simplifying the Science of Self-Assembly</b> <em>With Sushrut Tadwalkar</em> - UBC Math Undergraduate Student Research Seminar 2024</li>
    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Particle self-assembly is a rich and active area of interdisciplinary research, uniting all major branches of science. Self-assembly has the potential to revolutionize medicine and technology, by allowing us to build structures on the scale of microns, which has historically been an impossible task. Our talk will present new regimes to vastly improve self assembly, and outline powerful simulation tools for their verification, and development.</p>

    <h4>What I've been up to the past 4 years</h4>
</head>
<body>
    <p>In my first year at UBC I was a part of the development program for the rowing team. After my first year of University I worked at PedalHeads Trail, teaching children how to mountain bike. During my second year at UBC I joined the UBC wrestling club and Mathematics Society. In the summer after my second year I took part in the Summer Research Experiences program at UBC, on a computational project related to Elliptic Curves. During my third year I was a TA for computer science, and after my third year I did a math research project on particle self-assembly, additionally I helped plan and host the Canadian Undergraduate Math Conference at UBC. During my fourth year I wrapped up my summer research on self assembly and was a TA for group theory, treasurer for the Mathematics Society, and volunteer for the UBC math circle.</p>
