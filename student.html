    <p>Frederico Ardila's Axioms:

        <li>Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</li>
        <li>Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</li>
        <li>Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li>
        <li>Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</li>

    <p>My advice for navigating an undergraduate math degree at UBC:

        <li><b>First Year Students:</b></li>
        <li>If you do not have credit for first year calculus (or even maybe if you do) take Math 120/121 in your first year.</li>
        <li>If you do have credit for first year calculus try to take Math 226 and 227 in first year so you will be eligible for real analysis in second year.</li>
        <li>Try to take Math 223 in the second semester of your first year.</li>
        <li>Some good electives for first year math students are: Phys 106, Phys 108 and CPSC 110</li>

        <li><b>Second Year Students:</b></li>
        <li>If you are eligible, take ONE of Math 320/321, or Math 322/323 in second year. I personally recommend Math 320; I think most second year students will not be adequately prepared for Math 322/323 the way they are structured at UBC.</li>
        <li>Math 300 is a good course to take in second year.</li>
        <li>If you do not have the prerequisites for most third or fourth year courses, consider taking some computer science courses like CPSC 221, CPSC 213, CPSC 303 (secretly a math course) or CPSC 320. Also consider taking Philosophy 222/320/323, these are basically math courses.</li>
