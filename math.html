    A drawing of the Hopf Fibration by Lun-Yi Tsai that reminds me of Dr. Seuss.

    <p>My prefered resources for various topics:

        <li>Learning Linear Algebra: I learned most of my linear algebra from functional analysis and module theory, but having seen generally the context and exposition of <em>Linear Algebra Done Right</em> by Axler, I would suggest this book to undergrads. Relearning Linear Algebra: <em>Advanced Linear Algebra</em> by Roman.</li>
        <li>Learning Calculus: I have no idea how I learned calculus.</li>
        <li>Learning ODE: God help me if I ever need to solve one of these.</li>
        <li>Learning PDE: God help me if I ever need to solve one of these.</li>
        <li>Set Theory and Foundations: <em>Analysis I</em> by Tao.</li>
        <li>Learning Group Theory: <em>Topics in Algebra</em> by Herstein, Relearning Group Theory: <em>Basic Algebra I</em> by Jacobson.</li>
        <li>Learning Ring Theory: <em>Basic Algebra I</em> by Jacobson.</li>
        <li>Learning Galois Theory: <em>Basic Algebra I</em> by Jacobson and <em>Abstract Algebra</em> by <em>Dummit and Foote</em>, Learning More Galois Theory: <em>Algebra</em> by Lang.</li>

        <li>Learning Functional Analysis: <em>Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications</em> by Folland, as well as <a href="421notes.html">Some Fantastic Course Notes</a> by my professor Murugan.</li>
        <li>Learning Measure Theory: I have no idea why I learned measure theory.</li>
        <li>Learning Probability: <em>Probability: Theory and Examples</em> by Durrett.</li>
        <li>Learning (a very small amount in my case) Markov Chains: <em>Markov Chains and Mixing Times</em> by Levin and Peres.</li>
        <li>Learning Basic Complex Analysis: <em>Fundamentals of Complex Analysis with Applications to Engineering and Science</em> by Saff and Snider, Learning (a very small amount in my case) Complex Geometry: <em>Complex Geometry</em> by Huybrechts.</li>
        <li>Learning Basic (Algebraic?) Topology: <em>A Basic Course in Algebraic Topology</em> by Massey, Learning Algebraic Topology: <a href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/427527/Notes.pdf"> Some Fantastic Course Notes</a> by Williams, if a book is needed, <em>Algebraic Topology</em> by Hatcher - I am not particularly fond of this book but it seems to be the lesser of all evils.</li>
        <li>Learning Differential Topology: <em>Differential Topology</em> by Guillemin and Pollack, <em>Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology</em> by Bott and Tu, as well as <a href="difftopnotes.html">Some Fantastic Course Notes</a> by my professor Kupers Reference for Differential Topology: <em>Smooth Manifolds</em> by Lee, I would not try to learn from this book, but it has many useful facts.</li>
        <li>Learning Representation Theory for Finite Groups: I like <a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~webb/RepBook/RepBookLatex.pdf">This Book</a> by Webb, the standard reference <em>Linear Representations of Finite Groups</em> by Serre is also good. </li>
        <li>Learning Basic Category Theory: <a href="https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/context.pdf">Category Theory in Context</a> by Riehl, being comfortable with categorical language and methodology is still a work in progress for me.</li>
        <li>Reference For Basic Lie Theory: <em>Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and Representations: An Elementary Introduction</em> by Hall is simple rigorous and concise.</li>
        <li>Learning Elementary Number Theory: <em>An Introduction To - The Theory of Numbers</em> by Niven.</li>
